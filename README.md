# TravisCountyTX_Precincts
Attempt at wrangling data in Travis County, Texas precincts from the November 2020 General Election. 
End result is a CSV in which each precinct is labeled with the count of voters who chose Biden or Trump.

The raw data is too large to be uploaded; however, you can download a zip yourself at 
https://countyclerk.traviscountytx.gov/departments/elections/2020-cast-vote-record/.

The final CSV is uploaded in the repo. 0 represents Trump and 1 represents Biden.

I used an xlsx converter online to create the CSV files with the same names as the original Excel files.
