# TravisCountyTX_Precincts
Attempt at wrangling data in Travis County, Texas precincts from the November 2020 General Election. 
End result is a CSV (uploaded in the repo) in which each precinct is labeled with the count of voters who chose Biden (0) or Trump (1).

The raw data is too large to be uploaded; however, you can download a zip yourself at 
https://countyclerk.traviscountytx.gov/departments/elections/2020-cast-vote-record/.

I used an xlsx converter online to create the CSV files with the same names as the original Excel files.
